		"Elroy-Stienâ€™s lab is engaged with various research topics, all related to regulation of gene expression with emphasis on mRNA translation in mammalian cells in health and disease. Regulation of gene expression at the level of mRNA translation into proteins is fundamental to growth, differentiation and development of multi-cellular organisms.",
		"We integrate state-of-the-art research methodologies to study the neurodegenerative genetic Vanishing White Matter (VWM) disease, to design and develop novel therapies, and to study basic mechanisms that govern protein synthesis during the cell cycle."
