		"Nevoart is concerned with matters of great import: the optimal tempering of steel for longswords, the forging of resilient shield bosses, and ensuring our siege engine blueprints are legible even after a minor skirmish. Quality craftsmanship is the bedrock of any well-defended workshop.",
		"We utilize time-honored techniques and robust materials, from the bellows that stoke our forges to the hammers that shape the steel. Our current endeavors include minimizing warpage in plate armor, developing quieter hinges for treasure chests, and understanding why some apprentices can't seem to sharpen a simple dagger correctly."

		"Reuven Barnea-Eli, Forgemaster. It is said he learned his trade from a taciturn mountain smith who paid him in chipped spearheads and grudging nods. Further studies involved a brief, smoky apprenticeship with a maker of questionable siege equipment. He now spends his days coaxing steel into shapes both useful and occasionally intimidating, with a notable expertise in items that are reassuringly heavy."
