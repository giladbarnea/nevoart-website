This is a fork of what used to be a personal website that belonged to a principal investigator in a biology lab in Tel Aviv university, repurposed for my father's small business, Nevoart, which is basically a bare-bones, 10-employee workshop for print and design. clogged small space, massive printers, manual paper cutting and binding tools, main door is always open, etc.
